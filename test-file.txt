This is a test file for the chat application file transfer feature.

You can use this file to test the /file command:
  /file <username> test-file.txt

The file transfer protocol supports binary files as well, including:
- Text documents (.txt, .md, .log)
- Images (.jpg, .png, .gif)
- PDFs (.pdf)
- Archives (.zip, .tar.gz)
- Any other binary files

This lightweight implementation transfers files in memory, so it's best
suited for smaller files (under 10MB).

Have fun testing the chat application!
